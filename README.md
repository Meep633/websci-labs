# About
This repo shows the labs that I worked on in ITWS 4500 (Web Science Systems Development) at RPI. These labs built on top of each other, so if you go from lab 1 to lab 8, you can see the progression on my project.

# Lab Descriptions
## Lab 1
Create a news ticker that scrolls through news articles that are retrieved from either a JSON file or an API.
## Lab 2
Create an API that serves the frontend and has endpoints to retrieve and alter the news data.
## Lab 3
Incorporate external APIs into your API by creating endpoints that fetch and alter data from these external APIs.
## Lab 4
Rewrite the frontend with React.
## Lab 5
Create a database and collection, fill it in with data of your choosing, and create API endpoints to interact with the collection.
## Lab 6
Choose 3 APIs with similar data and create an ETL pipeline to load the data into a collection. Then, create API endpoints to interact with this collection.
## Lab 7
Create 2 data visualizations using the data you collected in lab 6.
## Lab 8
Make any last changes to make your project look complete.

Note: For more information on these labs, please look at `assignment.pdf` in each lab folder.

Additional Note: READMEs in each lab folder show what I thought about, what I did, and any sources I used at the time that I made the lab. These READMEs also contain a FQDN (http://zuhays.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/), but this link no longer works.
