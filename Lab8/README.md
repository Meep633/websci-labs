I wanted to make sure you can go to all pages from any page, so I updated my navbar to make that happen. I also organized my navbar a little better so that everything isn't shoved into one page which wouldn't make sense and also added a link to API documentation so that users would know how to use my endpoints. I also added options to my data visualization to let the user choose what stats they wanna compare in the scatterplot.

Creativity:
I separated my stuff from lab 6-7 with whatever I had before since they're pretty separate things. I made my navbars a little better by separating my NBA stats stuff from my news stuff since they were completely unrelated, and I also added a link to API documentation in it for the user's sake. I also allowed the user to have options with the data visualization to see whatever stats (that I have stored) they want.

ChatGPT:
- i have a form that makes a request to an endpoint which connects to mongodb and retrieves data. on the same page, when the page loads, i do queries to the same mongodb to retrieve data to display on the page. while all the data isnt retrieved yet, i wait to update my data on the page. if a user submits the form while that data is being retrieved, i get an error saying that client must be connected before running operations. what can i do to fix this
